      <h1>Chapter 1: The Awakening of a Beast Master</h1><p>In a city where only the strong survive, lived a young boy named Kiyanotoka Ash. He was weak, average, and not particularly good at anything. But one day, his life changed completely‚Äîthanks to a transmigration, just like those you read about in novels.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>At Shrek University, Kiyanotoka's life was miserable. He was constantly bullied and treated like a joke. Today was no different‚Äîjust another exhausting day. As he looked forward to going home, something strange happened.</p>

  <p>In a flash, he found himself in a mysterious bedroom.</p>

  <p>There was a slowly spinning ceiling fan above, a ticking wall clock, and a tall mirror beside the bed. This wasn't his room.</p>

  <p>Kiyanotoka turned toward the mirror and froze.</p>

  <p>The reflection staring back at him wasn't his. This version of him had white hair, deep blue eyes, a handsome face, and a fit, muscular body‚Äînothing like his real-world self.</p>

  <p><em>"Am I dreaming again?"</em> he muttered.</p>

  <p>He slapped his face hard.</p>

  <p>Nothing changed.</p>

  <p><em>"What the hell is going on...?"</em></p>

  <hr>

  <blockquote>
    <p>[ SYSTEM ACTIVATED ]<br>
    [ HOST: Kiyanotoka Ash ]<br>
    [ SPIRIT PET: ??? ]<br>
    [ SKILL: ??? ]<br>
    [ BODY LEVEL: ???... ]</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>"What the actual hell?!"</em></p>

  <p>Then came a flood of memories that weren't his:<br>
  He saw how his new self was adopted by kind parents‚Ä¶ only to lose them in a car accident. He'd been alone ever since.<br>
  This wasn't Earth. It was a world invaded by monsters, and humanity had nearly gone extinct‚Äîuntil people formed bonds with Spirit Beasts and fought back. Now, peace was maintained, but monsters still roamed freely.</p>

  <p>In this world, a person's worth was judged by their Spirit Beast.</p>

  <p>The stronger the beast, the greater the fame.</p>

  <h3>üêâ Spirit Beast Rankings:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>F Rank</li>
    <li>E Rank</li>
    <li>D Rank</li>
    <li>C Rank</li>
    <li>B Rank</li>
    <li>A Rank</li>
    <li>S Rank</li>
    <li>SS Rank</li>
    <li>SSS Rank</li>
    <li>SSS+ Rank</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Unfortunately, the previous owner of this body had no Spirit Beast at all. Weak and hopeless, he died alone in his room.</p>

  <p>Kiyanotoka, now understanding the situation, clenched his fists.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Alright. I've been given a second chance. I'll become the number one Spirit Beast Master in this world!"</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Just like in novels, he had a cheat system. He tried to activate it‚Äîby killing insects, doing pushups, anything he could think of. But nothing worked.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to give up, his bulky classmate Brad entered.</p>

  <p>Brad looked more beast than man, with muscles bursting through his shirt.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Hey, Kiyanotoka. Come with me," Brad growled.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Kiyanotoka followed, confused.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Why did you call me?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"That's none of your business. Just keep quiet and walk," Brad snapped.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As they reached the roadside, the system pinged.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>[ SYSTEM TASK ]<br>
    Task: Slap Brad across the face with full strength.<br>
    Reward: 1 Spin ‚Äì Fire Spirit Incubator<br>
    Failure: Death</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>"WHAT?!"</em> Kiyanotoka gasped. <em>"Are you trying to get me killed?! Look at his damn muscles!"</em></p>

  <p>Brad turned and glared at him.</p>

  <p>There was no way out.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"S‚Äësorry, Brad‚Ä¶ for this!"</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong>SMACK!</strong></p>

  <p>Kiyanotoka slapped him as hard as he could‚Äîthen bolted like his life depended on it.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"YOU BASTARD!" Brad roared. "COME BACK HERE!!"</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But Kiyanotoka was gone. He ran for ten minutes straight before collapsing near a quiet alleyway.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"God... only I know how I survived that hell."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Suddenly, the system responded.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>[ TASK COMPLETED ]<br>
    [ Reward: 1 Spirit Incubator Spin ]<br>
    Use now?<br>
    [ YES ] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ NO ]</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He didn't hesitate.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Yes!"</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A massive, glowing wheel appeared in front of him. It spun rapidly, colors flashing, symbols glowing.</p>

  <p>Then it stopped.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>[ CONGRATULATIONS, HOST ]<br>
    [ YOU HAVE RECEIVED: BABY FIRE DRAGON ‚Äì S RANK ]</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Kiyanotoka's eyes widened.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"No way... that was totally worth it!"</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>[ SYSTEM UPDATE ]<br>
    [ HOST: Kiyanotoka Ash ]<br>
    [ SPIRIT PET: S RANK ‚Äì BABY FIRE DRAGON ]<br>
    [ NEXT UPGRADE: Kill 10 Beasts ]<br>
    [ SKILL: ??? ]<br>
    [ CULTIVATION LEVEL: ??? ]</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A grin spread across his face.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"If this keeps going‚Ä¶ I really might become the best Spirit Beast Master in the world."</p>
