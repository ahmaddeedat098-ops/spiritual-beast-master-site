  <h3 id="ch1">Chapter 1: The Awakening Flame</h3>
  <p>Just as Kiyanotoka was celebrating his new Spirit Beast—a Baby Fire Dragon—a familiar voice echoed in the distance.</p>
  <blockquote>"You bastard, Ash! Get over here!"</blockquote>
  <p>It was Brad, storming toward him. His breathing was heavy. While muscular, his sheer bulk made it hard for him to run far.</p>
  <p>Brad's spiritual beast had awakened when he was young. In this world, spirit beasts are tied to the heart—their rank and form can't be altered once bonded. But Kiyanotoka, with his mysterious System, was... irregular.</p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h3 id="ch2">Chapter 2: The Real Show</h3>
  <p>Kiyanotoka’s System scanned Brad’s beast—the Dusk Wolf Cub, a shadow-type spirit beast. It wasn’t weak, but against Thamuz, the Fire Dragon, it stood little chance.</p>
  <div class="system">
    <strong>System Scan – Target: Brad</strong><br>
    Spirit Pet: Dusk Wolf Cub<br>
    Element: Shadow / Darkness<br>
    Skills: Shadow Pounce, Flicker Hide, Whimper Howl
  </div>
  <p>Brad launched the first attack. But the system-assisted defense from Thamuz quickly turned the battle around.</p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h3 id="ch3">Chapter 3: First Clash – Fire vs. Shadow</h3>
  <p>The alley lit with flame and shadow. Brad’s beast attacked from the darkness, but Thamuz repelled it with Blazing Scale Burst. Kiyanotoka commanded calmly, and every action felt like clockwork.</p>
  <div class="system">
    <strong>Victory</strong><br>
    Beast Defeated – +1 Kill<br>
    Progress to Dragon Evolution: 1 / 10
  </div>
  <p>And with the system’s help, a new opportunity emerged—his own skill path.</p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h3 id="ch4">Chapter 4: The Silent Commander</h3>
  <p>On the rooftop, Kiyanotoka chose his skill path in silence:</p>
  <blockquote>"I don't want to be the strongest… I want to lead the strongest."</blockquote>
  <div class="system">
    <strong>Skill Acquired:</strong> Tamer’s Command – Level 1<br>
    +1 Beast Slot<br>
    Title: Initiate Commander<br>
    System Hidden from External Scans
  </div>
  <p>At the Spirit Appraisal Grounds, he showed only what he wanted the world to see. While others suspected something odd, none could pinpoint the truth.</p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h3 id="ch5">Chapter 5: Into the Scorchwood Ridge</h3>
  <p>Kiyanotoka formed his squad—Fuyue Lin, Riku Kaen, and Maya Jin—and entered the deadly Scorchwood Ridge. With perfect coordination, they defeated Firetail Apes, then delved deeper.</p>
  <div class="system">
    <strong>Optional Challenge Unlocked:</strong> Defeat B-Rank Boss<br>
    Reward: Fire Crystal Shard
  </div>
  <p>They took down the Molten Horned Lizard through strategy, trust, and silent commands. And the system rewarded them:</p>
  <div class="system">
    Tamer’s Command → Level 2<br>
    Beast Evolution Material Acquired
  </div>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h3 id="ch6">Chapter 6: Echoes Beyond the Trial</h3>
  <p>Squad 7 returned victorious and drew the eyes of the academy. Kiyanotoka, still hiding his system, kept a low profile while planning his next bond.</p>
  <div class="system">
    <strong>Trait Quest:</strong> Commander's Domain (Bond 2/3 Required)<br>
    Objective: Form second bond<br>
    Beast Evolution: 12% Awakening
  </div>
  <p>And under the light of the moon, he found a second spirit beast—a Lunar Sylph-Hare. Gentle, elusive, and powerful.</p>

  <p>He welcomed it quietly, like a true commander working beneath the world’s notice.</p>
